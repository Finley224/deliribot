YOU NEED TO MAKE A CONFIG.JSON FILE WITH THE ```botUsername, botPassword and adminUsername``` KEYS!!!!!

OTHERWISE THE BOT WILL NOT WORK!!!!!!!

how to start up this mess:
1. cd to the file's directory in cmd
2. do `deno run --allow-all main.js`
3. if it nags you to update, shut the bot down with ctrl+c and do `deno add @mbw/roarbot@latest`
4. otherwise, it's running
